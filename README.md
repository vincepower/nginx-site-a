# NGINX Instance with custom HTML "Site A" and path "/a/"

This is used to test ingress related things so I know for sure it is routing properly.

Used in combination with the "Site B" version

I will rebuild every now and then so NGINX is up to date.

Deployment steps
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincepower/nginx-site-a/main/deploy.yml`
```
